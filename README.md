Documentation for Command-Line Quiz Application

Introduction:
The Command-Line Quiz Application is a Java-based project developed using Eclipse IDE for Java development. 
It allows users to create quizzes, store them in a MySQL database managed through MySQL Workbench, and take quizzes through a simple command-line interface. 
This documentation provides a step-by-step guide to setting up and using the application.

Step 1: Setting Up Development Environment:
1) Install Eclipse IDE for Java development.
2) Download and install MySQL Workbench for database management.

Step 2: Creating Maven Project:
1) Create a new Maven project in Eclipse.
2) Add necessary dependencies in the pom.xml file, including the MySQL JDBC driver for database connectivity.

Step 3: Database Setup:
1) Open MySQL Workbench and create a new database for the quiz application.
2) Design the database schema to include tables for topics, questions, options, correct answers.

Step 4: Database Connectivity:
1) Implement a Java class to handle database connectivity using JDBC.
2) Configure the database connection parameters (URL, username, password) in the Java code.
3) Implement methods to insert quiz questions into the database and retrieve questions for the quiz.
   
Step 5: Implementing Quiz Functionality:
1) Define an interface class QuizDao to declare methods for creating quizzes, taking quizzes, and list quizzes.
2) Create an implementation class QuizImplementation to implement the methods declared in the interface.
3) Implement methods in QuizImplementation to create a quiz, take a quiz, and display quiz results.

Step 6: Writing Main Method:
1) Write the main method in a separate Java class to execute the quiz application.
2) Instantiate the QuizImplementation class and call its methods to perform quiz-related operations.
3) Provide options for users to create a quiz, take a quiz, or exit the application.
4) Handle exceptions and errors gracefully.
   
Step 7: Testing and Debugging:
1) Compile the Java code in Eclipse.
2) Run the compiled Java program to test the command-line quiz application.

Conclusion:
----------
The Command-Line Quiz Application developed using Eclipse and MySQL Workbench provides a simple yet effective way to create and take quizzes through a command-line interface. 
By following the steps outlined in this documentation, users can set up and use the application to create, store, and take quizzes efficiently.
The use of an interface class and implementation class helps in organizing the code and separating concerns, making it easier to maintain and extend the application in the future.
